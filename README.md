# Masters-Project-Anuraj-Bhatnagar


Presto Manifesto! is a clicker game based on policy and the relationship between governance, economy and climate change. 

This project was created as part of my Masterâ€™s Project at Georgia Tech.
Instructions

Click on button nodes to implement research and build facilities. There are multiple defeat states, but only one victory state.

Click on the facilities/research on the top right to move between research and facilities.

There are two types of button nodes- research nodes and facility nodes. These nodes are viewable on the research tree and the facility tree respectively.

Each node requires some resources. There are three resources- conventional energy, wealth and novel energy. The resource requirements for each node are given below them.

The + above each node indicates how resource gathering rate is affected by the button. 

Click and drag the Screen to move around. Some buttons will not be visible without moving the screen in this manner.

Scroll inwards and outwards to zoom.
